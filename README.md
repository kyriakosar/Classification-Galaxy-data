The data set (available on Brightspace) contains data about different astronomical observations
and their classification into one of three types of objects. The following columns are available:
alpha: Right Ascension angle (at J2000 epoch)
delta: Declination angle (at J2000 epoch)
u: Ultraviolet filter in the photometric system
g: Green filter in the photometric system
r: Red filter in the photometric system
i: Near Infrared filter in the photometric system
z: Infrared filter in the photometric system
field ID: Field number to identify each field
MJD: Modified Julian Date, used to indicate when a given piece of SDSS data was taken
redshift: Redshift value based on the increase in wavelength
plate: Plate ID, identifies each plate in SDSS
class: Class labels (target for your classification tasks)
